## üß© Overview

The **Payment Stream Protocol** enables users to **create, withdraw, and cancel continuous payment streams** in Aptos Coin (APT).
It allows funds to be distributed **linearly over time**, ensuring recipients receive payments in a predictable and transparent manner.

This is especially useful for:

* Payroll automation
* Subscriptions or recurring payments
* Grants and vesting schedules
* Time-based donations or community rewards

---

## üöÄ Features

* ‚è± **Time-based Streaming:** Funds are unlocked linearly between start and end timestamps.
* üîê **On-chain Fund Locking:** Coins are securely held in the contract during the stream duration.
* üí∏ **Partial Withdrawals:** Recipients can withdraw vested funds anytime.
* ‚ùå **Cancelable Streams:** Senders can cancel streams and get unvested funds refunded.
* üßæ **Event Tracking:** Every create, withdraw, and cancel action emits on-chain events for transparency.
* üìä **View Functions:** Query stream status, details, and available balances.

## üèóÔ∏è Module Structure

**Module Path:**

```
payment_stream_addr::payment_stream

**Key Components:**

| Component              | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PaymentStream`        | Represents an individual payment stream with sender, recipient, timing, and balance info |
| `StreamRegistry`       | Global storage maintaining all active and past streams                                   |
| `StreamCreatedEvent`   | Emitted when a stream is created                                                         |
| `StreamWithdrawnEvent` | Emitted when a recipient withdraws funds                                                 |
| `StreamCancelledEvent` | Emitted when a stream is canceled                                                        |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functions

### üèÅ `initialize(account: &signer)`

Initializes the module for the deploying account.
Creates the global `StreamRegistry` if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be called **once** during deployment.

---

### üíß `create_stream(sender: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64, duration_seconds: u64)`

Creates a new payment stream.

**Validations:**

* Duration and amount must be > 0
* Sender must have sufficient APT balance

**Flow:**

1. Withdraws `amount` of APT from the sender
2. Locks it in a new `PaymentStream`
3. Emits a `StreamCreatedEvent`

**Emitted Event:** `StreamCreatedEvent`
**Error Codes:**
`E_INVALID_DURATION`, `E_INVALID_AMOUNT`, `E_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`

---

### üí∏ `withdraw(recipient: &signer, stream_id: u64)`

Allows the recipient to withdraw vested funds.

**Flow:**

1. Calculates available (vested) amount
2. Transfers that amount to the recipient
3. Updates withdrawn total
4. Emits `StreamWithdrawnEvent`

**Emitted Event:** `StreamWithdrawnEvent`
**Error Codes:**
`E_STREAM_NOT_FOUND`, `E_NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `E_STREAM_ALREADY_CANCELLED`, `E_NO_FUNDS_AVAILABLE`

---

### üö´ `cancel_stream(sender: &signer, stream_id: u64)`

Allows the sender to cancel an ongoing stream.

**Flow:**

1. Calculates vested (earned) vs unvested (refund) funds
2. Transfers vested funds to recipient
3. Refunds unvested funds to sender
4. Marks stream as cancelled
5. Emits `StreamCancelledEvent`

**Emitted Event:** `StreamCancelledEvent`
**Error Codes:**
`E_STREAM_NOT_FOUND`, `E_NOT_AUTHORIZED`, `E_STREAM_ALREADY_CANCELLED`

## üß† How Vesting Works

Let:

* `total_amount` = 100 APT
* `duration` = 100 seconds
* `start_time` = 0
* `end_time` = 100

If current time = 40s ‚Üí vested = `40/100 * 100 = 40 APT`.
Recipient can withdraw up to 40 APT, and the rest remains locked until more time passes.

---

## üß∞ Example Workflow

1. **Initialize**

   ```bash
   aptos move run --function-id 'payment_stream_addr::payment_stream::initialize' --account <deployer>
   ```

2. **Create Stream**

   ```bash
   aptos move run --function-id 'payment_stream_addr::payment_stream::create_stream' \
     --args address:<recipient_addr> u64:100000000 u64:3600
   ```

   ‚è≥ Streams 1 APT over 1 hour.

3. **Withdraw**

   ```bash
   aptos move run --function-id 'payment_stream_addr::payment_stream::withdraw' \
     --args u64:<stream_id>
   ```

4. **Cancel Stream**

   ```bash
   aptos move run --function-id 'payment_stream_addr::payment_stream::cancel_stream' \
     --args u64:<stream_id>
   ```
